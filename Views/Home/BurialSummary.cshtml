<h1>Burial Summary List and Burial Record Pages</h1>

<h2>A paginated list of all burials with a brief summary of the info.</h2>
<h2>The ability to filter the results by certain criteria</h2>
<h2>The database has many, many fields, and we do not expect you to be able to filter by all</h2>
<h2>The client will have some insight into which filter options should take priority</h2>
<h2>The ability to select a specific record and pull up the details of the burial (i.e. field notes, photographs, measurements, and any details captured about the mummy or items included in its burial.)</h2>
